          Why Corporate Law Matters
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          Corporate law is the backbone of any business entity. Whether you're
          launching a startup, expanding internationally, or restructuring your

          Failure to adhere to legal requirements can result in penalties, loss
          of business opportunities, or litigation.
